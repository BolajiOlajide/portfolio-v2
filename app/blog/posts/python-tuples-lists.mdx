Tuples and Lists are commonly-used data structures used in Python. A lot of libraries and projects use them in different ways. They are both heterogeneous collections of items - i.e it can hold a combination of several types of data such as strings, integers etc.

They are both very similar, some of the properties they have in common include:

- They can hold any data type (strings, integers, dictionaries etc can be stored in a tuple or a list)
- Items in a tuple or list can be accessed via it's index
- They are ordered.

Seeing how similar they are, what then is the difference between a tuple and a list?

### Tuples

Tuples are denoted with parentheses. Example:

```python
names = ('bolaji',)
items = ('apple', 'oranges', 'pineapple')
items = (1,2,[12],('bill',))
```

Notice when we are initialising a tuple with just one item, we append a trailing comma to it. The parenthesis don't automatically make them tuples. You have to add a comma after the string to indicate to python that it should be a tuple, however this isn't compulsory when you have more than one item in the tuple.

You can also create tuples using the `tuple` constructor which takes a collection as it's argument and converts to a tuple.

```python
names = tuple(['bolaji'])
```

### Lists

Lists are denoted with square brackets. It is somewhat similar to what you'll call an array in other programming languages like Javascript.

```python
names = ['bolaji']
items = ['apple', 'oranges', 'pineapple']
```

You can also create a list with the `list` constructor which takes a collection as it's argument and converts to a list.

```python
names = list(('bolaji',))
items = list(('apple', 'oranges', 'pineapple'))
```

The main difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable while a tuple is immutable. Once you define a list, you can append, remove, shift and replace items in that list but that can't be done with a tuple. A tuple can be regarded as a strict data structure because once defined, it can't be changed.

> Mutability refers to the liability or tendency for something to change.

Some folks get confused by what mutability means in this context as python doesn’t have the `const` keyword to define a variable that can’t be changed. I had this same thought when I was learning about tuples, coming from a JavaScript background. The concept of mutability here has to do with the items in the collection and not the variable itself.

Take a look at the screenshot below to understand what happens when you try to mutate a tuple.

From the screenshot above, you can see that overwriting the item at index 2 in the list is fine but when we try to do the same with a tuple we get an error.

Tuples are used whenever we want to ensure immutability in a collection so no user action can overwrite the content at the index. However, we can reassign something else to the variable `store_tuple` because the variable is only a container that holds a reference to the tuple we created.

Another thing to note is that though each tuple element in its self is immutable, values of mutable element in a tuple are not.

```python
my_tuple = (8, 'kali', {'first_name': 'bran'}, [1, 5, 9])
my_tuple[3][0] = 100

print(my_tuple) // (8, 'kali', {'first_name': 'bran'}, [100, 5, 9])
```
