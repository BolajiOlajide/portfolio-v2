Setting up MySQL for development on your Mac can be tricky and stressful at times, a lot of developers I know don't like to go through that hassle. This prompted me to write this article to walk you through the steps I take to set up MySQL on my Mac.

## Prerequisites

1. A Macbook
2. Homebrew installed on your Mac (Installation guide can [be found here](https://brew.sh/))

### Installing MySQL

I usually install MySQL via Homebrew. Confirm you have Homebrew installed by running the command below in terminal:

```sh
brew -v
```

Once you've confirmed you have Homebrew installed, the next step is to install MySQL using the command

```sh
brew install mysql
```

This command will install the latest version of MySQL (v8.0.21 as at the time of writing) on your Mac.
Once the installation is done, you can start MySQL as a background service with the command

```sh
brew services start mysql
```

or

```sh
mysql.server start
```

if you don't need it as a background service.

### Setting up MySQL

Once MySQL has been installed we need to create a user and assign roles to that user. The first step we will take is to access the `mysql` shell using the `root` user - to do this we will use the command

```sh
mysql -u root
```

This will take you to the `mysql` shell and you should see the `mysql>` prompt.
The prompt should look similar to this 👇🏽:

```sh
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 8
Server version: 8.0.21 Homebrew

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

Now that we are in the `mysql` shell, we will be writing MySQL statements to perform several actions for us.

We will approach the setup in three phases:

1. Create a new user
2. Grant privileges to the new user
3. Access the shell using the newly created user

#### Create new user

To create a new MySQL user, we will use the command

```sql
CREATE USER 'user_name'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';
```

Remember to replace `user_name` and `user_password` with the username and password you'd like to access MySQL with and also ensure you terminate the statement with a semicolon (`;`), else the statement won't be executed upon by MySQL.

#### Grant Privileges

Now that we've created our user, we need to grant privileges, this will determine how much power this new user wields. Here's a breakdown of the different types of privileges in MySQL:

- `ALL PRIVILEGES`: Gives the said user access to all privileges.
- `CREATE`: Allows a user to be able to create a database(s).
- `DROP`: Allows a user to delete a database(s).
- `DELETE`: Allows a user to delete rows from a table.
- `INSERT`: Allows a user insert rows into a table.
- `SELECT`: Allows a user query for records in a table.
- `UPDATE`: Allows a user to update rows of records in a table.
- `GRANT OPTION`: Allows a user to grant/remove other user's privileges.

Depending on whichever privilege you prefer to grant the newly created user, you can actually grant the privilege with the command:

```sql
GRANT privilege ON *.* TO ‘user_name’@'localhost’;
```

An example is `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bolaji'@'localhost';` to grant the user with the name `bolaji` all privileges.

Once you're done granting permissions, you can use the `SHOW GRANTS` command to show the privileges assigned to any user, an example is shown below:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'bolaji'@'localhost';
```

Now that we've created a user and granted the said user some privileges. Let's quit our current mysql session by entering the command `quit` in the mysql shell.

#### Access the shell

We can start another session of mysql using the user we just created. This time we will be using a different command

```sh
mysql -u user_name -p
```

The `-p` flag means that we'd be prompted for a password once we hit the enter key. For super users like `root`, we didn't need to enter the `-p` flag because no password was set for the `root` user.

Once we are in, we can confirm the current user with the command below:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_USER();
```

Now that we are done, you can use mysql for any of your dev project using the credentials you created your user with.
